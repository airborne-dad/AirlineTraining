title: The One Where Day Two Finds Its Rhythm at ATP

Today kicked off much like the previous ones: I woke up early for a workout in the tiny hotel gym, improvising a routine with the limited equipment on hand. After that, it was back to the classroom for another day of ATP training. The content’s starting to get more interesting, covering everything from checklist philosophies to physiology and operational considerations. We watched fewer accident videos than before, but the ones we did see were just as eye-opening—reminders that it’s always easier to critique someone’s decisions in hindsight, especially when they were under intense pressure.

Even though these examples are from real incidents, I’m seeing how one small misjudgment can spiral into a much bigger problem. It’s making me appreciate the course more. We’re not learning specific airline policies yet, but hearing our instructor’s personal experiences and picking up general airline best practices has been valuable. Since the final exam is broken down and reviewed little by little in class, there’s not a ton of pressure—but by the end of the day, I’m still beat.

Lunch was a highlight: they offered Chick-fil-A and Middle Eastern cuisine. I went for a chicken gyro, which was delicious—though I regretted polishing it off when I felt uncomfortably stuffed afterward. At one point, I tried to sneak in some study time for the ATP written exam but found it hard to concentrate with the lecture going on, so I gave up and refocused on the discussion.

After class, I realized I wasn’t in the mood to wrangle the hotel van for another dinner outing, so tonight’s plan is simple: leftover snacks from Day One and calling it an early night. Sometimes the best option is to just relax and recharge. Stay tuned for the next post—who knows what tomorrow’s “One Where…” will bring!
