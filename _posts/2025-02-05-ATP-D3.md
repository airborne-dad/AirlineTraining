title: The One Where Day Three at FlightSafety Gets More Interesting

I actually managed to get some decent sleep last night, and it made today feel a whole lot better. The material also wasn’t as dry as the past couple of days—definitely more engaging overall. We dove into topics like automation (how autopilot functions work in general), jet engine basics (turbines, turbofans, etc.), and meteorology essentials like windshear, turbulence, and icing. While the weather content wasn’t entirely new, it’s always a good refresher.

Tomorrow is our last day of ground school, which means we have the test coming up, and then on Friday, we jump into sims. I’m looking forward to the simulator sessions—I’ve never flown a jet before, and my only “jet” time has been messing around with computer flight sims. Should be fun to see what the real deal feels like.

One more day of classroom content, then it’s test time!
