title: The One Where INDOC Days Three and Four Roll into a Relaxing Weekend

INDOC days three and four were pretty uneventful—at least by airline-training standards. We covered a few more topics, then everything led up to our INDOC validation test: a 50-question, open-book exam on our iPads, where we could reference all the manuals and guides we’d been studying. We needed at least 40 correct answers to pass, so it wasn’t high stress. I personally flew through it pretty quickly, figuring extra time wouldn’t magically improve my score, and it seems everyone else did the same—we all passed with flying colors.

After a couple more lessons, we were dismissed around noon, which effectively gave us two and a half days off before week two. Naturally, a group of us headed to a local spot called the Old Town Tavern. A few drinks in, we all loosened up and started chatting about life beyond aviation—always nice to learn about people’s backgrounds, families, and interests instead of just regurgitating airplane talk 24/7. We wrapped up the night around 11, and I woke up the next morning hangover-free—a small but meaningful victory.

Saturday was as chill as it gets. I tackled some laundry, binge-watched random shows, and basically hid out in my room. Sunday followed the same relaxed vibe—I hung out in the breakfast area with some classmates until around noon, then did a little studying in the afternoon. That pretty much sums up the weekend.

Now I’m looking ahead to week two, feeling recharged and ready for whatever the training center decides to throw at us next.
