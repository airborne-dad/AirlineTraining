Last night, a few of my classmates and I kicked things off early by grabbing dinner at a restaurant right next to our hotel. It was a great chance to hear everyone’s backstory—where they’ve flown, how they ended up here, and so on. I always appreciate these moments because it helps break the ice before a big course like ATP-CTP.

My day started around 5 AM (as usual), which included a quick workout at the hotel gym before breakfast. When I got back to my room, I discovered my gallon of milk had leaked all over the mini-fridge because I’d left it on its side. Lesson learned: those bottles really aren’t designed to be stored any way except upright!

Another important reminder from dinner was that I still needed to schedule my ATM written exam. Logging into the PSI system proved tricky because of newly added multi-factor authentication, which I hadn’t set up yet. I managed to call customer service this morning and sort it out—just in time to run downstairs for the hotel van. While waiting in the lobby, I scheduled the exam, only to realize I didn’t have all the details (like the official training center name and completion dates) that we learned later in class. One step at a time, I guess.

We have a group of thirteen, and our van wasn’t exactly built for a baker’s dozen. Someone had to wait for a later ride or grab an Uber. Once we arrived at FlightSafety, we picked up our badges and went to check in. Because I’d uploaded all my documents beforehand, my check-in was super quick—maybe two minutes tops. It turned out Monday is a big start day for various programs, so the place was buzzing with people enrolling in their own courses.

After check-in, the director of the training department introduced himself and led us to our classroom, where our instructor was already waiting. We started a bit earlier than scheduled—always a pleasant surprise—and dived right into the plan for the week, then straight into today’s focus: leadership and safety. We looked at real-world accidents that showed just how important it is to stay vigilant, use your resources, and avoid complacency in the cockpit. Nothing drives the point home like seeing what can go wrong when pilots let their guard down.

FlightSafety gave us plenty of breaks, which really helped keep everyone refreshed. At one point, I realized I needn’t have bothered bringing my own snacks because FlightSafety provides free drinks, coffee, snacks, and fruit—restocked regularly. The bathrooms are also impressively clean and stocked with personal care supplies, reminiscent of a really nice FBO bathroom. I also wish I had brought an extra container to save some of the breakfast or lunch for later, because sometimes I’m just not hungry enough for a full meal, even though the catered food is great.

The building was a bit confusing at first, but once you get a feel for the layout, it’s not too bad. Lunch was catered on-site, and today’s spread was mostly Mexican fare—tasty, filling, and not too pricey. I spent the break chatting with more classmates and even some folks from other programs. It’s always fascinating to hear about everyone’s aviation journey and what brought us all here.

The afternoon session continued the leadership and safety discussions. Over the rest of the week, we’ll be covering more advanced topics like airline operations and meteorology. After class, we waited another 20–30 minutes for the van. This time, we squeezed twelve people in, with one person practically perched in the trunk area. It was a warm ride, but we made it back in one piece.

Tonight, we’re heading back to the same restaurant as yesterday, but with a larger group. Hopefully, everyone can make it so we can keep building on that camaraderie. After all, spending time together outside the classroom is half the fun of training.

Stay tuned for tomorrow’s installment—who knows what “The One Where…” will bring next!
