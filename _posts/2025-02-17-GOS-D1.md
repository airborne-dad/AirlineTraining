title: The One Where We Finally Get to Jump Down the Emergency Slide

Week two is all about General Operating Subjects (GOS), which means each day brings a new set of topics to dive into. Today's topics included everything from Hazmat procedures to CFIT/ALAR (a throwback to ATP-CTP’s scenario-based lessons) to aerodynamics and performance modules. Today was a blast because we finally got some hands-on practice with the cabin trainer, which took everything we learned in class so far and brought it to life. After a quick debriefing, we started by looking at the actual emergency equipment—items we’d only seen in manuals or PowerPoints until now—and got a feel for where they’re stored and how to use them. After that, we moved on to the cabin door, opening it from the outside first to see the mechanics behind it, then doing it from the inside under normal conditions before stepping it up a notch by simulating an emergency opening and deploying the slide.

With the slide still buzzing in our minds, we switched gears and practiced extinguishing a mock fire. Even though the fire extinguisher was just a trainer model, it’s reassuring to know exactly what to do if a real one ever flares up. Next came the mock cabin itself. We learned how everything is stowed, then moved forward to the cockpit area to see how to put on the oxygen mask and adjust its different settings. We also checked out some other critical cockpit equipment, got a sense of the various configurations for the oxygen mask, and tried out the jump seat. Finally, we got to do the best part—sliding down the emergency slide. Since it’s not every day you get to launch yourself out of an aircraft door, a few of us went down twice just to make the most of it.

After lunch, reality set in: we reviewed Hazmat protocols in detail and took a short exam, breezed through some CFIT/ALAR scenarios that reminded me of the cautionary tales from ATP-CTP, and even tackled aerodynamics and performance (which was originally slotted for tomorrow, but hey, we’re eager beavers). By the end of the day, we’d covered an impressive amount of material and were slightly ahead of schedule, leaving just enough time to get a head start on the next day’s lessons. I’m wrapping up the night with some light studying and maybe a grocery order, feeling grateful that not every aspect of training is strictly desk-bound. Here’s to more days that blend the serious with the seriously fun.
